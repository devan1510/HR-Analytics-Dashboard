HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI & Power Query
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of transforming raw, unstructured HR data into meaningful insights using Power Query and Power BI. The dataset was provided in a dirty CSV format, containing inconsistencies, missing values, and unstandardised fields. Power Query was used to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis, after which Power BI was used to build interactive reports and dashboards.

The goal of this project is to showcase data cleaning, modelling, and visualisation skills while enabling data-driven decision-making for HR stakeholders.
